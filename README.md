# Anti-exploration-RL
Anti exploration in offline reinforcement learning


One of the biggest challenges in offline reinforcement learning is the distribution mismatch between the current policy and the offline data collection policy. More specifically, this situation happens when the policy being learned takes a different action than the dataset's action. This concept can be considered as an anti-exploration scheme in offline reinforcement learning. This project aims to translate strategies from exploration in online settings as the penalty in offline learning.
